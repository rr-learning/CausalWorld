### How to reproduce experiments from CausalWorld paper?

Run the following command to reproduce experiments (training and evaluation) reported in the paper 
CausalWorld: : [*A Robotic Manipulation Benchmark for Parametric Generalization and Causal Structure Learning paper*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04296.pdf)


```
python CausalWorld/scripts/reproduce_experiments.py --task=pushing --output_path=experiments_pushing --model_num=0
```

where you either need to pass `pushing`, `picking`, `pick_and_place` or `stacking2` for the `task` argument. 
`model_num` accepts model numbers from  0 to 44 mapping to individual agents trained under this task.
This yields a folder with the model number in `experiments_pushing` that contains the trained agent 
(including an animation and tensorboard logs), protocol evaluations and further result visualizations.
To activate tensorboard logging use the flag `--tensorboard_logging`.

Once all 45 models for a respective task-space are trained an aggregated bar plot figure with
evaluation protocol scores can be generated by running

```
python CausalWorld/scripts/visual_aggregated_analysis.py --models_path=experiments_pushing --output_path=aggregated_plots_pushing --title=Pushing 
```

saving them in the `output_path folder`.
